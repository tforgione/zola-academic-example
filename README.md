*This is a work in progress, it can't hold a candle to hugo-academic*

# Getting started

You should first [install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).

Once that's done, I suggest that you start by cloning the example site, with the zola-academic theme as a submodule:

``` bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tforgione/zola-academic-example
```

Then, you should be able to go in the `zola-academic-example` directory and run

```
zola serve
```

to see if everything is working and have some fun.
